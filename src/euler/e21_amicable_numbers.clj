;; Let d (n) be defined as the sum of proper divisors of n 
;;  (numbers less than n which divide evenly into n) .
;; If d (a) = b and d (b) = a, where a â‰  b, then a and b are
;;  an amicable pair and each of a and b are called amicable numbers.

;; For example, the proper divisors of 220 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11,
;;  20, 22, 44, 55 and 110; therefore d(220) = 284. The proper divisors
;;  of 284 are 1, 2, 4, 71 and 142; so d(284) = 220.

;; Evaluate the sum of all the amicable numbers under 10000.
